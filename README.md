## CHARACTER DESIGN ANALYSATION!!

hi i did cool analysation on different character designs from all the media i have consumed~
it was a super fun progress, im proud of it!! this was also my first ever time trying data science and ITS SUPER HELPFUL!!
IDK WHY I NEGLECTED IT BEFORE(maybe because it seemed scary) but hey! we learn new things everyday!

you can try the presentation out here! [Analysis Presentation!!](https://www.figma.com/deck/Jl0yOwXlCoTUmzr22HZxYE/Analysis-presentation-?node-id=1-42)

**note: please click arrow keys to move to the next slides so you dont miss out on any animations!! its super fun and engaging i promise you will love it!!**

### what i learnt!!
- i learnt how to get started with *pandas* to make dataframes, and also clean and update data in it!
- *numpy* for calculations and processing(?) the data the way i want
- and making beautiful data visualisations in *matplotlib*!!
- i also learnt how to work with a *jupyter notebook*, thankfully, it went well and SUPER EASY!!!
the learning curve was very fun to do, very simple, its always fun to work on things you like with the newly learnt skills! 

i also did everything myself, making the datasets, cleaning, visualising, all of it! felt like a detective working on a mystery haha!
found really important stuff that can help me advance my career, as i want to make beautiful illustrations in the future for my own games, stories!

### i wanna get better, make beautiful art alongside all the cool skills i learn along the journey!

and again, **i did this!!** IM SO PROUD OF MYSELF!! i hope everyone will like it too as much a i do~
